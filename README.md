### Manager Console for the Andon System
Made for the project: <b>Wireless Reconfigurable Andon System with Maintenance Prediction</b>, done in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the module <i>EN 2160 Engineering Design Realization.</i>

The above works were done by Silva M.K.Y.U.N (@yasith46) and Senavirathne I.U.B. (@isuranga1). For making of the GUI, <b>Codux</b> was used.

Codux is an all-in-one visual development environment. Whether youâ€™re starting a new app, creating components, or editing an existing project, every visual change you make reflects instantly in the code and vice versa.

This project was bootstrapped with [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev). It includes a single React component to start the project with, a sample [`codux.config.json`](codux.config.json) with preconfigured keys, a `package.json` file to describe the project's packages and dependencies, and a folder and component structure to put everything neatly in its place.

- Edit, render and compose apps that make use of **`React`**-based components.
- Create components with **`TypeScript`**, **`SCSS`** and **`CSS Modules`** support.
- Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.

### Steps to run open the web application
1. Download the entire folder
2. In the Windows Command Prompt, enter the command `npm run build`. This builds the application in production mode into a folder named `dist`. This folder can be served using any HTTP server.
3. Enter `npm run dev`
4. Enter `npm run preview`, which will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at [`http://localhost:4173`](http://localhost:4173)
